[Apple Compressor](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/compressor/id424390742?mt=12) allows you to batch transcode audio and video files to a variety of different file types. However, annoyingly, it does not provide a straightforward way to apply the same output file type setting to multiple files at once. Fortunately there is a simple workaround to this. From your toolbar go to:

```
Compressor > Preferences > General
```

The first option there allows you to "Set a default setting and location for new jobs." Select the output file type you want to apply to your batch of files using the default `Setting` option. Now when you drag your batch of files into Compressor they will all have this transcoding job applied to them by default.
